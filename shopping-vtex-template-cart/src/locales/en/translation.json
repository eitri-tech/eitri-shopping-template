        "description": "Inspired by leading Chinese apps, Eitri emerged from Calindra's extensive experience in developing mobile applications, especially for e-commerce. The goal was to make this process more scalable, flexible, agile, secure, and modular. Its name is derived from the dwarf in Norse mythology who forged Mj√∂lnir and other magical artifacts for the gods, showcasing exceptional skills as a blacksmith and builder. This archetypal connection to Norse mythology draws an analogy to how building applications with Eitri is so fast and practical that it feels like magic.",
